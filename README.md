## Content
This repo includes a replication file for the keyword search for systematic literature review of mediation analysis and codebook used.


## Sharing/Access Information
Files: 
- Data_extracting.R
- codebook_updated.xlsx

The Data_extracting.R script contains code used for extracting keywords relevant to the systematic literature review. It processes multiple papers, identifies the study or experiment sections within each, and extracts only those sections. From these extracted sections, the script detects keywords related to mediation analysis.

The codebook_updated.xlsx file provides the coding rules applied in the review, along with detailed explanations for each coding criterion.

## Reproducibility
The analysis was conducted using R version 4.4.1. The full list of package versions can be found in [session_info.txt](session_info.txt).
